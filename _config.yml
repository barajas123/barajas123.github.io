  Hi, my name's Andy and I'm a Software Engineer. As well as building and designing microservices I also have some experience in data analysis and a strong interest in the quantatative financial space. I have worked on building my own ETL pipelines and services related to the Financial Sector. The last 3 years I've spent learning whatever technology was needed to do the job.

  I am skilled in: <mark>Golang, Microservices, Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes</mark> and <mark> Python </mark>
